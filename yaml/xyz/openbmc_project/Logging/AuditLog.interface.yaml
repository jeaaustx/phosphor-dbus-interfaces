    This interface provides methods to add user space events to the Linux audit
    log and to extract the Linux audit logged events.
enumerations:
    - name: Result
      description: >
          Result of operation being logged.
      values:
          - name: Success
            description: >
                Operation completed successfully.
          - name: Fail
            description: >
                Operation failed to complete.
methods:
    - name: PopulateAuditLog
      description: >
          Parses previously recorded log events into JSON format. Nothing is
          returned to caller. It will write them as individual entries on the
          DBus. This is a WIP for comparing file approach to DBus approach.
          SHOULD NOT BE MERGED.
      parameters:
          - name: maxCount
            type: uint32
            description: >
                Defines the maximum number of entries to parse. Minimum value is
                0.

    - name: GetAuditLog
      description: >
          Parses all previously recorded log events into JSON format. Returns a
          read-only file descriptor to the parsed file. Entries are sorted
          oldest to newest.
